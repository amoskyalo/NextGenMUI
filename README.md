NextGenMUI is a plugin that integrates seamlessly with the popular React UI framework Material-UI, offering additional functionality and customization options to streamline the development process.
It consists of a collection of pre-styled easy-to-use components that efficiently manage dialogs, handle user interactions, and create dynamic and responsive forms and other features, while following Material-UI's design specifications.

Incorporating NextGenMUI components contributes to an improved development experience and enhanced user interfaces in your React applications.

## Installation

Run one of the following commands to add NextGenMUI to your React project:

```shell
yarn add next-gen-mui

npm install next-gen-mui
```

## Usage

After installation, import the components and start using them.

## Components

1. **AlertDialogModel**: The purpose of this component is a modal or dialog box with an alert interface that interrupts the userâ€™s workflow to present important information and capture a response. Examples include action confirmation prompts and error message confirmations. Key features include customizable titles and content texts, straightforward action handling with **Ok** and **Cancel** buttons, and adjustable sizing for various application contexts.

   **Usage**:

   ```javascript
   import { AlertDialogModel } from "next-gen-mui";

   const App = () => {
     const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

     return (
       <AlertDialogModel
         open={open}
         onClose=//close function
         onAction=//action function ( ok )
         dialogContentText="Are you sure you want to delete"
         dialogTitle="Delete"
       />
     );
   };
   ```

2. **DialogModel**: The purpose of this component is to create dialog modals within the user interface . Dialog is a type of modal window that temporarily interrupts the user's interaction with the main content to present important information, requests for confirmation, or input forms.Key features include flexible width settings, adjustable maximum width, and a clean, responsive design with an optional title and a close button.

   **Usage**

   ```javascript
   import { DialogModel } from "next-gen-mui";

   const App = () => {
     const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

     return (
       <DialogModel
         open={open}
         title="Dialog Model Title"
         onClose={"close function"}
         //other props
       >
         <p>This is a Dialog model and is open</p>
       </DialogModel>
     );
   };
   ```

3. **FormModel**: The purpose of this component is to render a form within a modal dialog window based on the provided input configuration. It supports various input types, including password fields with visibility toggle, and provides real-time validation feedback.Key features includes adjustable grid columns, input widths, and a dynamic schema ensure flexibility for diverse form layouts.

   **Usage**

   ```javascript
   import { FormModel } from "next-gen-mui";

   const App = () => {
     const inputs = [
       {
         name: "username",
         label: "Username",
         type: "text",
         value: "",
       },
       {
         name: "password",
         label: "Password",
         type: "password",
         value: "",
       },
       {
         name: "isAdmin",
         label: "Is Admin",
         lookups: [
           { title: "Yes", value: 0 },
           { title: "No", value: 1 },
         ],
         value: "",
       },
       {
         name: "roles",
         label: "Roles",
         lookups: [
           { title: "Edit", value: 3 },
           { title: "Delete", value: 6 },
           { title: "Add", value: 12 },
         ],
         multiple: true,
         value: [
           { title: "Edit", value: 3 },
           { title: "Delete", value: 6 },
         ],
       },
     ];

     return (
       <FormModel
         inputs={inputs || []}
         width={400}
         onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}
         //other props
       />
     );
   };
   ```

4. **StepperFormModel**: The purpose of this component is to provide the functionality of a stepper (or multi-step) form with that of a modal dialog. It allows users to complete a form in a step-by-step manner within a modal window, making it perfect for scenarios like registrations or multi-stage data entries, offering customizable step labels, input fields, and navigation buttons.

   **Usage**

   ```javascript
   import { StepperFormModel } from "next-gen-mui";

     const steps = [
       {
         label: "Step 1",
         inputs: [
           {
             name: "username",
             label: "Username",
             type: "text",

             value: "",
           },
         ],
       },
       {
         label: "Step 2",
         inputs: [
           {
             name: "isAdmin",
             label: "Is Admin",
             lookups: [
               { title: "Yes", value: 0 },
               { title: "No", value: 1 },
             ],
             value: "",
           },
           {
             name: "roles",
             label: "Roles",
             lookups: [
               { title: "Edit", value: 3 },
               { title: "Delete", value: 6 },
               { title: "Add", value: 12 },
             ],
             multiple: true,
             value: [{ title: "Edit", value: 3 }], //will be passed as the default values for this input,
           },
         ],
       },
     ];

     return (
       <StepperFormModel
         steps={steps || []}
         width={400}
         onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}
         //other props
       />
     );
   };
   ```

5. **GridModel**: The purpose of this component is to set up a grid component to display tabular data with custom column configuration, data rows, and styling. The component seamlessly integrated with material UI is designed for flexibility and ease of use. It supports features like dynamic data rendering, printing, and exporting functionalities.It also includes interactive elements such as a calendar for date filtering, custom button actions, and an option to add new data entries, making it suitable for a wide range of data management tasks.

           //   <p>{params.name}</p>
           // )
         },
       },
       {
         name: "Clients",

       list: [...navigation],
     },
     {
       title: "Accounts",
       list: [
         {
           name: "Chat",
           icon: ChatBubbleIcon
         },
         {
           name: "Settings",

           name: "Logout",
           icon: LogoutIcon
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
   }

     return (
       <SideBarModel
           navigateItems=//if it has section, nav, else navigation
           NavHeader={NavHeader}
           openHeader={open}
           activeTabBackgroundColor="#395759"
           backgroundColor="#001d25"
           textColor="#c8cecf"

           listItemButton: {
               border: "1px solid red",
               padding: .7
           }
           listItemButton: (list) => (
               {
               border: "1px solid red",
               paddingY: list.isActiveTab ? 1 : 0
               }
           ),
           listItemText: {
               color: "red"
           },
           getColor: (params) => {
               return params.isActiveTab ? "red" : "white"
           }
           }}
       />
     )
   };
   ```

    import { PopoverModel } from "next-gen-mui";

    const App = () => {
    const [anchorEL, setAnchorEl] = useState(null);
    const open = Boolean(anchorEL);

     const options = [
       {
         name: "Add",
         icon: //icon ( optional ),
         onItemClick: (e) => {
           console.log(e);
         },
       },
        {
         name: "Delete",
         icon: //icon ( optional ),

         icon: //icon ( optional ),
         onItemClick: (e) => {
           console.log(e);
         },
       }
     ];

     return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={(e) => setAnchorEL(e.currentTarget)}>open menu</button>
            <PopoverModel popoverItems={options} open={open} />
        </div>
